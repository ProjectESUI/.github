# Project ESUI: A Curated Cat Repositories

## Overview

Welcome to ESUI, the organization dedicated to curating and maintaining a collection of cat-related repositories on GitHub. Our mission is to bring together the best and most interesting projects related to cats in one centralized hub. Whether you're a cat lover, developer, or simply curious, ESUI is the go-to place for all things feline on GitHub.

## Objective

Our primary objective is to fork and curate existing cat-related repositories to create a comprehensive and well-organized list of projects. By centralizing these repositories, we aim to make it easier for cat enthusiasts, developers, and researchers to discover and contribute to a wide range of cat-centric projects.

## How It Works

1. **Forking Repositories:** ESUI will regularly scan GitHub for repositories related to cats. We will fork these repositories into the ESUI organization to create a centralized collection.

2. **Curating Content:** Our team will review and curate the forked repositories, ensuring that only high-quality and relevant projects are included in the ESUI collection.

3. **Maintaining the List:** We will actively maintain the curated list, adding new repositories, updating descriptions, and removing outdated or inactive projects.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community! If you know of a cat-related repository that should be included in ESUI or if you want to contribute to the curation process, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Fork the ESUI repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Add a Repository:** Create a new branch and add the details of the cat-related repository you want to include in the `repositories.md` file.

3. **Submit a Pull Request:** Submit a pull request with your changes. Our team will review the additions, and if they meet our criteria, we'll merge them into the curated list.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that ESUI follows a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure a positive and inclusive environment for all contributors. Be respectful and considerate when interacting with others within the ESUI community.
